            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Akuma is a seemingly brutal, angry, quite honorable and proud warrior who enjoys training and has contempt for true
                weaklings. He is rarely seen smiling and enjoys fighting formidable warriors, such as Ryu. He also hates it when
                somebody actually interferes with his training. He is also quite serious in fighting and enjoys getting stronger. In his
                conversations with many warriors, he tends to talk about their fists and his own. He truly hates Gouken for not using
                their fighting style in the way that it is intended to be used, and hates him even more for sealing off the Satsui no
                Hadou in Ryu from taking over him. He is also very independent and fights alone.
                
                Akuma's personality is very dark and negative towards other people, he believes that abandoning all positive emotions
                and fighting with rage and hate is the way all warriors should battle. He sees compassion and caring for others as a
                weakness. Because of his personality, many warriors do not like him as a person, believing that he only cares about
                strength and power. One such person is Ryu, who admonishes him for throwing away his own humanity.

            <h2>Moral Code</h2>
            <p>Akuma fights only to test his strength and his opponent's. This means that he will only fight opponents that will
            provide a challenge, hence his refusal to fight unworthy challengers under any circumstances. Akuma will only kill
            opponents who are as strong as he, stronger than him or who he finds worth killing, which is why he stopped his fight
            with Gen after realizing that he was ill and dying. While Akuma killed his brother and his teacher, he did so in the
            confines of the code of the warrior, where the field of battle does not distinguish between friend or foe. Akuma
            believes he committed no transgression whatsoever. Also, with the exception of Gouken and Goutetsu, Akuma usually only
            fights those who challenge him instead of picking fights.
            
            Capcom USA initially claimed Akuma was possessed by a demon, but the fabrication was easily caught and not accepted as
            canon. The character's name change from Gouki to Akuma (the Japanese and American names, respectively) reflects Capcom
            USA's attempt to accentuate the demonic nature; the word Akuma (悪魔, Akuma) means "devil" in Japanese (although it should
            be noted that the Japanese version of his English name uses the phonetic katakana syllabary which does not necessarily
            hold the same intrinsic meaning as the kanji version).
            
            Perhaps in an attempt to revisit the demon possession theme, Akuma is given an even stronger form, known as Oni, who has
            near demon-like appearance and mannerisms, and has abandoned even his moral code.</p>
